            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <section>
                <h3>Sunset Grill is Ontario’s number one destination for great breakfast and lunch!</h3>
                <p>Our story is quite simple. In 1985 our founder, Angelo Christou, opened Sunset Grill’s doors for the
                    first time in the Beaches area of Toronto, Ontario. Armed with the basic philosophy that Fresh is
                    Tastiest™, Sunset Grill quickly developed long lineups of loyal customers. With huge popularity and
                    consistent service, it quickly became the place to be for the best breakfast in town.</p>
                <p>It is said that when something works, don’t change it. After more than 30 years in business, we
                    realize that while the world around us has evolved, our concept and methods have not changed. After
                    all, good food, fast service and a pleasant experience is what a successful restaurant is all about.
                </p>
                <p>Our food and preparation methods are 5-star inspired and quality is never sacrificed. All our menu
                    items are cooked fresh to order using healthy methods: flat top grills, pat dry bacon and nothing is
                    ever deep fried. With choices such as our famous bacon and 3 eggs for breakfast or our flagship
                    Sunset Burgers for lunch, we invite you try our restaurants for an experience you can count on!</p>
